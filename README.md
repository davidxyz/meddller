## meddller website
ruby on rails app that has users recommend content to other users

#Background information
I made this meddller website with jQuery, bootstrap, font-awesome, and ruby on rails app. I was curious and wanted to make a website for the fun of it. I made this website during my gap year and it was online for about 3 months with minimal traffic. So i stopped paying for virtual machine hosting and the domain name expired. I still work on it from time to time, but I have since moved on to other personal projects outside of website design.
